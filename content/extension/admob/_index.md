# Project Settings

To use this extension, you have to support me on Patreon with a 2nd or higher tier. You can become a patron here https://patreon.com/Lerg

Once you become a patron, I will send you an access key. Open `game.project` and these two entries to the `dependencies` property:
* `https://build.spiralcodestudio.com/PATREON_EMAIL/ACCESS_KEY/defold/admob.zip`
* `https://static.spiralcodestudio.com/defold/admob_dep.zip`

Replace `PATREON_EMAIL` with your Patreon email and `ACCESS_KEY` with the key I send you. E.g. `https://build.spiralcodestudio.com/name@gmail.com/0123456789/defold/admob.zip`

Then select `Project -> Fetch Libraries` to download the extension in your project.

You need to set the AdMob App Id for your iOS and/or Android app in `game.project`. To do so open your `game.project` and add these lines:
```
[admob]
ios_app_id = ca-app-pub-***~***
android_app_id = ca-app-pub-***~***
```

Replace `ca-app-pub-***~***` with your app ids. It can now be viewed or changed in the normal view of the `game.project` file.

You need Defold version 1.2.165+

You can check if an ad has been loaded with [admob.is_loaded()](#function_is_loaded) method or you can listen to the [admob](#event_admob) event with a loaded phase:
```lua
-- Inside admob listener.
if event.type == 'interstitial' and event.phase == 'loaded' then
	admob.show('interstitial')
end
```

Banners don't need this method because they are displayed automatically when loaded.

# Test Ads

ALWAYS use test ads during the development. Only switch to the real ads for submitting to the stores. To enable test ads use `test = true` option in the [admob.init()](#function_init) call.

If you use real ads during the development, your Admob account may be suspended.

# Demo

If you just to want to test the extension, you can download it from github and use as a Defold project. It will function as a demo. You don't need an Admob account for the demo.

# Usage

Use [admob.init()](#function_init) to initialize it when your app starts. A good place for that would be the `init()` function of some root game object. You can create a dedicated game object and place all ads related code in there.

Once the init process if finished (you can listen for the `'init'` phase/type in the [admob](#event_admob) event or you can just wait), you can start loading ads. It's good to preload ads before you actually need to display it. Use [admob.load()](#function_load) to load and [admob.show()](#function_show) to show the ads.

When an ad has been closed (phase equals `'closed'`) you can preload next ad.

Banners are displayed automatically when loaded, no need to call [admob.show()](#function_show) for them, however to remove a banner, you would need to use [admob.hide_banner()](#function_hide_banner).
